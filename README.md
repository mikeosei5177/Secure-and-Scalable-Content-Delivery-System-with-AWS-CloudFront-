**Building a Global Content Delivery Network with AWS CloudFront, S3, and Route53**

**Introduction**

In this project, I implemented a complete content delivery solution using AWS services to demonstrate how modern cloud infrastructure can deliver web content efficiently and securely across the globe.

**Situation**

Static websites and content-heavy applications face several challenges: slow load times for geographically distant users, lack of HTTPS security, scalability concerns during traffic spikes, and the complexity of managing custom domains. I needed to address these pain points while keeping the solution cost-effective and maintainable.

**Task**

My objective was to architect and deploy a content delivery system that would:
- Serve static content from a reliable origin
- Distribute content globally through edge locations
- Provide HTTPS security with a custom domain
- Ensure high availability and fault tolerance
- Optimize performance through intelligent caching
